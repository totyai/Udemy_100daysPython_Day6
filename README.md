# Udemy_100daysPython_Day6
This is a repository I use for code from [Udemy's 100 days Python - Day 6](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/19110394#overview)

## Topics to cover
- Functions
- Code Block
- While loop

Mainly working in [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html) to test out all the concepts learned.
In the files I am adding the code, I used/created within the web environment.
